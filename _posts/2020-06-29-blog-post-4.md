You take me in during my most desperate moment. You taught me to learn, to dream, to live and to love with all the patience that parents can be. 

You raise me up a to see the scenery that I could never have possibly seen, you accompany me to help me though during my difficult moment. You make fundimental changes in my life. There's no need to compare, you already give me all the things a parent can give and you are all important to me. Blood is an important thing, but it does not define everything. 

It's such a blessing to be your child. Thank you all, I am what I am because of you all. 

I love you 3000.

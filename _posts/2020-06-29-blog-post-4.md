You take me in when I was a white paper. You taught me to learn, to dream, to live and with all the patience that parents can be. 

You raise me up a to see the scenery that I could never have possibly seen, you also help me though during my difficult moment. You make fundimental changes in my life. There's no need to compare, we are the writer of our own story, stories are unique for different people, that's the reason why the world is so colorful. You give me all the things a parent can give and you are all important to me. It's because of blood that usually starts everything, but patience and caring that keep connecting people together.

It's such a blessing to be your child. Thank you all, I am only what I am because of you all. 

During my birthday, I want to thank my parents for everything, I love you 3000~

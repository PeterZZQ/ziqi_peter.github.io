To my beloved:

You took me in when I was a white paper. You taught me to learn, to dream, to live with all the patience that one can give. You raise me up on your shoulder to let me see the scenery that I could never have possibly seen, you also help me though during my difficult moment. You make me realize maybe I, as medicore and normal as a human being could be, can also shine sometimes, you make me always remain my most pure, beautiful and childish side in front of you. With this I'm so sure that you gave me almost all the things parents can give.

There's no need to compare, it's been such a long time for me to gradually realize you are all important to me, and you're such a small group and I have so enough energy/love to scatter around all of you. This mixed and strong feeling of happy and a little worried fills my heart, happy that I have so many cares around me, but also worried that I could unintentionally break all the beautiful stuffs as I can be so careless sometime. However, I never have such a strong hope too. There are so many examples that make me believe that it's because of blood that everything starts, but blood does not define everything, its truly the patience and caring that keep connecting people together, but I also believe that we are the writer of our own story, stories can be unique for different people, that's the reason why the world is so colorful. And I can make my story unique and pretty too.

During my birthday, I want to thank my parents/mentors for everything. It's such a blessing to be your student and your child at the same time.

I still remember the time that you said I have potential, which is the most most beautiful words I have ever heard, but you know what, I am mainly what I am because of you, because I know how I was like before. There's still long way to go, I'll keep all of that in my heart during my journey. 

I so so love you all. I love you 3000~

(I so want to grasp everytime time that I have to express my feelings, because there are so few opportunities. I'll write it down, in case one day when things are no longer what they were before, we all can still remember all the beautiful parts. And sorry that I always receive and currently have so less to give back, wish that it will not be the same in the future:).)

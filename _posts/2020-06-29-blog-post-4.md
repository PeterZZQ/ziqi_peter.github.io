To my beloved:

You take me in when I was a white paper. You taught me to learn, to dream, to live with all the patience that parents can give.

You raise me up on your shoulder to see the scenery that I could never have possibly seen, you also help me though during my difficult moment. You make me realize maybe I, as medicore as a normal human being could be, can also shine, you make me still remain my most pure, beautiful and childish side in front of you. You make fundamental changes in my life. With this I'm so sure that you gave me almost all the things a parent can give.  

There's no need to compare, you are all important to me, and you're such a small group and I have so enough energy/love to scatter around all of you. As I tend to be so cautious, this mixed and strong feeling of happy and a little worried fills my heart, but I never have such a strong hope too. There are so many examples that make me believe that it's because of blood that everything starts, but blood does not define everything, its truly the patience and caring that keep connecting people together, but I also believe that we are the writer of our own story, stories can be unique for different people, that's the reason why the world is so colorful. And I can make my story unique and pretty too.

During my birthday, I want to thank my parents/mentors for everything. It's such a blessing to be your student and your child at the same time. 

I still remember the time that you said I have potential, which is the most most beautiful words I have ever heard, but you know what, I am only what I am because of you all. There's still long way to go, I'll keep all of that in my heart during my journey. 

I so so love you all. I love you 3000~ 

(I guess as people grow up, as they start to loss/almost loss something/someone, they start to treasure everytime time that they have to express their feelings. Just want to write it down, in case one day when things is no longer what is was before, me & you all can still remember all the beautiful parts:))

You take me in when I was a white paper. You taught me to learn, to dream, to live with all the patience that parents can give.

You raise me up to see the scenery that I could never have possibly seen, you also help me though during my difficult moment. You make me realize maybe I, as medicore as a human being could be, can also shine, you make me still remain my most pure, beautiful and childish side in front of you. You make fundamental changes in my life. With this I'm so sure that you gave me almost all the things a parent can give.  

There's no need to compare, you are all important to me. As I tend to be so cautious, this mixed and strong feeling of happy and a little worried fills my heart, but I never have such a strong hope too. I believe that it's because of blood that everything starts, but blood does not define everything, its truly the patience and caring that keep connecting people together. I also believe that we are the writer of our own story, stories can be unique for different people, that's the reason why the world is so colorful.

During my birthday, I want to thank my parents/mentors for everything. It's such a blessing to be your student and your child. I still remember the time that you said I have potential, which is one of the most most beautiful word I have ever heard, but you know what, I am only what I am because of you all. There's still long way to go, I'll keep all of that in my heart during my journey. 

You are the witness of my growth, and I'll also be the legacy of your love. 

I so so love you all. I love you 3000~ 

(Just want to write it down, in case one day when things become difficult, I can still remember all the beautiful parts:))
